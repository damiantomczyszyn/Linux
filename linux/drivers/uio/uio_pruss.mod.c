n interrupt which signals that the previous buffer has been
 * DMAed successfully and that it can be returned to userspace.
 *
 * It also sets the final jump of the previous buffer to the start of the new
 * buffer, thus chaining the new buffer into the DMA chain. This is a single
 * atomic u32 write, so there is no race condition.
 *
 * The end-result of all this that you only get an interrupt when a buffer
 * is ready, so the control flow is very easy.
