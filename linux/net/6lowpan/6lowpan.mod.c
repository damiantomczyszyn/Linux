 we were to improve the
 * storage performance, we'd have a proportional reduction in IO-wait time.
 *
 * This all works nicely on UP, where, when a task blocks on IO, we account
 * idle time as IO-wait, because if the storage were faster, it could've been
 * running and we'd not be idle.
 *
 * This has been extended to SMP, by doing the same for each CPU. This however
 * is broken.
 *
 * Imagine for instance the case where two tasks block on one CPU, only the one
 * CPU will have IO-wait accounted, while the other has regular idle. Even
 * though, if the storage were faster, both could've ran at the same
