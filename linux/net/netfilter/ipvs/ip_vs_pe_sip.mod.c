	 * Special setup for check_redundant().
	 *
	 * To report redundant, we need to find a strong dependency path that
	 * is equal to or stronger than <src> -> <target>. So if <src> is E,
	 * we need to let __bfs() only search for a path starting at a -(E*)->,
	 * we achieve this by setting the initial node's ->only_xr to true in
	 * that case. And if <prev> is S, we set initial ->only_xr to false
	 * because both -(S*)-> (
