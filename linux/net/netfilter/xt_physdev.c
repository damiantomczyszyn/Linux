 * @target_entry: pointer to the target of a matched path
 * @offset: the offset to struct lock_class to determine whether it is

 * We may have multiple edges (considering different kinds of dependencies,
 * e.g. ER and SN) between two nodes in the dependency graph. But

 * strong dependency path is a dependency path that doesn't have two adjacent

 *         Documentation/locking/lockdep-design.rst
 *
 * for more explanation of the definition of strong dependency paths

 *     In lock_list::only_xr, we record whether the previous dependency only
 *     has -(*R)-> in the search, and if it does (prev only has -(*R)->), we
 *     filter out any -(S*)-> in the current dependency and after that, the
 *     ->only_xr is set according to whether we only have -(*R)-> left.
