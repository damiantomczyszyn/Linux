 * __rcu_irq_enter_check_tick - Enable scheduler tick on CPU if RCU needs it.
 *
 * The scheduler tick is not normally enabled when CPUs enter the kernel
 * from nohz_full userspace execution.  After all, nohz_full userspace
 * execution is an RCU quiescent state and the time executing in the kernel
 * is quite short.  Except of course when it isn't.  And it is not hard to
 * cause a large system to spend tens of seconds or even minutes looping
 * in the kernel, which can cause a number of problems, include RCU CPU
 * stall warnings.
 *
 * Therefore, if a nohz_full CPU fails to report a quiescent state
 * in a timely manner, the RCU grace-period kthread sets that CPU's
 * ->rcu_urgent_qs flag with the expectation that the next interrupt or
 * exception will invoke this function, which will turn on the scheduler
 * tick, which will enable RCU to detect that CPU's quiescent states,
 * for example, due to cond_resched() calls in CONFIG_PREEMPT=n kernels.
 * The tick will be disabled once a quiescent state is reported for
 * this CPU.
 *
 * Of course, in carefully tuned systems, there might never be an
 * interrupt or exception.  In that case, the RCU grace-period kthread
 * will eventually cause one to happen.  However, in less carefully
 * controlled environments, this function allows RCU to get what it
 * needs without creating otherwise useless interruptions.
