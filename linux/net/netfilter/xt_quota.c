	 * For RT, an irq inversion happens when we have lock A and B, and on
	 * some CPU we can have:

	 *	lock(A);
	 *	<interrupted>
	 *	  lock(B);
	 *
	 * where lock(B) cannot sleep, and we have a dependency B -> ... -> A.
	 *
	 * Now we prove local_lock() cannot exist in that dependency. First we
	 * have the observation for any lock chain L1 -> ... -> Ln, for any
	 * 1 <= i <= n, Li.inner_wait_type <= L1.inner_wait_type, otherwise
	 * wait context check will complain. And since B is not a sleep lock,
	 * therefore B.inner_wait_type >= 2, and since the inner_wait_type of
	 * local_lock() is 3, which is greater than 2, therefore there is no
	 * way the local_lock() exists in the dependency B -> ... -> A.
	 *
	 * As a result, we will skip local_lock(), when we search for irq
	 * inversion bugs.
