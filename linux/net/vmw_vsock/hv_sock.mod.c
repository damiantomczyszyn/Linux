	 * In preemptible kernels, ->rcu_read_lock_nesting tells the tick
	 * whether the current CPU is in an RCU read-side critical section,
	 * so the tick can report quiescent states even for CPUs looping
	 * in kernel context.  In contrast, in non-preemptible kernels,
	 * RCU readers leave no in-memory hints, which means that CPU-bound
	 * processes executing in kernel context might never report an
	 * RCU quiescent state.  Therefore, the following code causes
	 * cond_resched() to report a quiescent state, but only when RCU
	 * is in urgent need of one.
