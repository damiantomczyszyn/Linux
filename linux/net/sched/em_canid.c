(of runnable tasks) this is provided by the following means:
 *
 *  A) UNLOCK of the rq(c0)->lock scheduling out task t
 *  B) migration for t is required to synchronize *both* rq(c0)->lock and
 *     rq(c1)->lock (if not at the same time, then in that order).
 *  C) LOCK of the rq(c1)->lock scheduling in task
 *
 * Release/acquire chaining guarantees that B happens after A and C after B.
 * Note: the CPU doing B need not be c0 or c1
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   CPU0            CPU1            CPU2
 *
 *   LOCK rq(0)->lock
 *   sched-out X
 *   sched-in Y
 *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
 *
 *                                   LOCK rq(0)->lock // orders against CPU0
 *                                   dequeue X
 *                                   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
 *
 *                                   LOCK rq(1)->lock
 *                                   enqueue X
 *                                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
 *
 *                   LOCK rq(1)->lock // orders against CPU2
 *                   sched-out Z
 *                   sched-in X
 *                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
 *
 *
 *  BLOCKING -- aka. SLEEP + WAKEUP
 *
 * For blocking we (obviously) need to provide the same guarantee as for
 * migration. However the means are completely different as there is no lock
 * chain to provide order. Instead we do:
 *
 *   1) smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0)   -- finish_task()
 *   2) smp_cond_load_acquire(!X->on_cpu) -- try_to_wake_up()
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   CPU0 (schedule)  CPU1 (try_to_wake_up) CPU2 (schedule)
 *
 *   LOCK rq(0)->lock LOCK X->pi_lock
 *   dequeue X
 *   sched-out X
 *   smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0);
 *
 *                    smp_cond_load_acquire(&X->on_cpu, !VAL);
 *                    X->state = WAKING
 *                    set_task_cpu(X,2)
 *
 *                    LOCK rq(2)->lock
 *                    enqueue X
 *                    X->state = RUNNING
 *                    UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
 *
 *                                          LOCK rq(2)->lock // orders against CPU1
 *                                          sched-out Z
 *                                          sched-in X
 *                                          UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
 *
 *                    UNLOCK X->pi_lock
 *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
 *
 *
 * However, for wakeups there is a second guarantee we must provide, namely we
 * must ensure that CONDITION=1 done by the caller can not be reordered with
 * accesses to the task state; see try_to_wake_up() and set_current_state().

/**
 * try_to_wake_up - wake up a thread
 * @p: the thread to be awakened
 * @state: the mask of task states that can be woken
 * @wake_flags: wake modifier flags (WF_*)
 *
 * Conceptually does:
 *
 *   If (@state & @p->state) @p->state = TASK_RUNNING.
 *
 * If the task was not queued/runnable, also place it back on a runqueue.
 *
 * This function is atomic against schedule() which would dequeue the task.
 *
 * It issues a full memory barrier before accessing @p->state, see the comment
 * with set_current_state().
 *
 * Uses p->pi_lock to serialize against concurrent wake-ups.
 *
 * Relies on p->pi_lock stabilizing:
 *  - p->sched_class
 *  - p->cpus_ptr
 *  - p->sched_task_group
 * in order to do migration, see its use of select_task_rq()/set_task_cpu().
 *
 * Tries really hard to only take one task_rq(p)->lock for performance.
 * Takes rq->lock in:
 *  - ttwu_runnable()    -- old rq, unavoidable, see comment there;
 *  - ttwu_queue()       -- new rq, for enqueue of the task;
 *  - psi_ttwu_dequeue() -- much sadness :-( accounting will kill us.
 *
 * As a consequence we race really badly with just about everything. See the
 * many memory barriers and their comments for details.
 *
 * Return: %true if @p->state changes (an actual wakeup was done),
 *	   %false otherwise.
