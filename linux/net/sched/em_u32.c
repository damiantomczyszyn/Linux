idate the following rules:
 *
 *  - would the adding of the <prev> -> <next> dependency create a
 *    circular dependency in the graph? [== circular deadlock]
 *
 *  - does the new prev->next dependency connect any hardirq-safe lock
 *    (in the full backwards-subgraph starting at <prev>) with any
 *    hardirq-unsafe lock (in the full forwards-subgraph starting at
 *    <next>)? [== illegal lock inversion with hardirq contexts]
 *
 *  - does the new prev->next dependency connect any softirq-safe lock
 *    (in the full backwards-subgraph starting at <prev>) with any
 *    softirq-unsafe lock (in the full forwards-subgraph starting at
 *    <next>)? [== illegal lock inversion with softirq contexts]
 *
 * any of these scenarios could lead to a deadlock.
 *
 * Then if all the validations pass, we add the forwards and backwards
 * dependency.
