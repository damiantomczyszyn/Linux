ackwards for a lock dependency,
 * 	for a lock dependency A -> B, there are two lock_lists:
 *
 * 	a)	lock_list in the ->locks_after list of A, whose ->class is B and
 * 		->links_to is A. In this case, we can say the lock_list is
 * 		"A -> B" (forwards case).
 *
 * 	b)	lock_list in the ->locks_before list of B, whose ->class is A
 * 		and ->links_to is B. In this case, we can say the lock_list is
 * 		"B <- A" (bacwards case).
 *
 * 	The ->trace of both a) and b) point to the call trace where B was
 * 	acquired with A held.
 *
 * 2)	A "helper" lock_list is introduced during BFS, this lock_list doesn't
 * 	represent a certain lock dependency, it only provides an initial entry
