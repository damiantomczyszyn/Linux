 * By default RT tasks run at the maximum performance point/capacity of the
 * system. Uclamp enforces this by always setting UCLAMP_MIN of RT tasks to
 * SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE.
 *
 * This knob allows admins to change the default behavior when uclamp is being
 * used. In battery powered devices, particularly, running at the maximum
 * capacity and frequency will increase energy consumption and shorten the
 * battery life.
