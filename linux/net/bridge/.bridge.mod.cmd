/*
 * Print torture statistics.  Caller must ensure that there is only one
 * call to this function at a given time!!!  This is normally accomplished
 * by relying on the module system to only have one copy of the module
 * loaded, and then by giving the lock_torture_stats kthread full control
 * (or the init/cleanup functions when lock_torture_stats thread is not
 * running).
