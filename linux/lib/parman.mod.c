(of runnable tasks) this is provided by the following means:
 *
 *  A) UNLOCK of the rq(c0)->lock scheduling out task t
 *  B) migration for t is required to synchronize *both* rq(c0)->lock and
 *     rq(c1)->lock (if not at the same time, then in that order).
 *  C) LOCK of the rq(c1)->lock scheduling in task
 *
 * Release/acquire chaining guarantees that B happens after A and C after B.
 * Note: the CPU doing B need not be c0 or c1
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   CPU0            CPU1            CPU2
 *
 *   LOCK rq(0)->lock
