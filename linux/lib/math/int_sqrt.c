 * finish_task_switch - clean up after a task-switch
 * @prev: the thread we just switched away from.

 * finish_task_switch must be called after the context switch, paired
 * with a prepare_task_switch call before the context switch.
 * finish_task_switch will reconcile locking set up by prepare_task_switch,
 * and do any other architecture-specific cleanup actions.

 * Note that we may have delayed dropping an mm in context_switch(). If
 * so, we finish that here outside of the runqueu
