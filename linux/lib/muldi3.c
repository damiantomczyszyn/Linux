/*
 * We are about to add A -> B into the dependency graph, and in __bfs() a
 * strong dependency path A -> .. -> B is found: hlock_class equals
 * entry->class.
 *
 * If A -> .. -> B can replace A -> B in any __bfs() search (means the former
 * is _stronger_ than or equal to the latter), we consider A -> B as redundant.
 * For example if A -> .. -> B is -(EN)-> (i.e. A -(E*)-> .. -(*N)-> B), and A
 * -> B is -(ER)-> or -(EN)->, then we don't need to add A -> B into the
 * dependency graph, as any strong path ..-> A -> B ->.. we can get with
 * having dependency A -> B, we could already get a equivalent path ..-> A ->
 * .. -> B -> .. with A -> .. -> B. Therefore A -> B is redundant.
 *
 * We need to make sure both the start and the end of A -> .. -> B is not
 * weaker than A -> B. For the start part, please see the comment in
 * check_redundant(). For the end part, we need:
 *
 * Either
 *
 *     a) A -> B is -(*R)-> (everything is not weaker than that)
 *
 * or
 *
 *     b) A -> .. -> B is -(*N)-> (nothing is stronger than this)
