/*
 * Dependency path printing:
 *
 * After BFS we get a lock dependency path (linked via ->parent of lock_list),
 * printing out each lock in the dependency path will help on understanding how
 * the deadlock could happen. Here are some details about dependency path
 * printing:
 *
 * 1)	A lock_list can be either forwards or backwards for a lock dependency,
 * 	for a lock dependency A -> B, there are two lock_lists:
 *
 * 	a)	lock_list in the ->locks_after list of A, whose ->class is B and
 * 		->links_to is A. In this case, we can say the lock_list is
 * 		"A -> B" (forwards case).
 *
 * 	b)	lock_list in the ->locks_before list of B, whose ->class is A
 * 		and ->links_to is B. In this case, we can say the lock_list is
 * 		"B <- A" (bacwards case).
 *
 * 	The ->trace of both a) and b) point to the call trace where B was
 * 	acquired with A held.
 *
 * 2)	A "helper" lock_list is introduced during BFS, this lock_list doesn't
 * 	represent a certain lock dependency, it only provides an initial entry
 * 	for BFS. For example, BFS may introduce a "helper" lock_list whose
 * 	->class is A, as a result BFS will search all dependencies starting with
 * 	A, e.g. A -> B or A -> C.
 *
 * 	The notation of a forwards helper lock_list is like "-> A", which means
 * 	we should search the forwards dependencies starting with "A", e.g A -> B
 * 	or A -> C.
 *
 * 	The notation of a bacwards helper lock_list is like "<- B", which means
 * 	we should search the backwards dependencies ending with "B", e.g.
 * 	B <- A or B <- C.
